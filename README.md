# Directed Research: The Impact of AI on Women in the Labor Market

## Overview
This research project investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) impacts women in the labor market, particularly examining the extent to which AI technologies amplify biases and inequalities. The study focuses on analyzing the risk of AI exposure across different occupations and its implications for women, who are often overrepresented in roles with higher AI exposure risk.

## Features

### Key Contributions:
- **AI Exposure Risk Analysis:**
  - Collected and cleaned occupation data from ONET and AI patent data from Google Patents.
  - Extracted verb-noun pairs from over 900 occupational tasks and approximately 15,700 lines of AI patent descriptions.
  - Matched occupational verb-noun pairs with AI patent data and calculated AI exposure risk scores using the formula from Michael Webbâ€™s paper.

- **Gender Distribution and Risk Evaluation:**
  - Analyzed gender distribution in high-risk occupations identified through AI exposure scores.

### Skills Developed:
- Advanced data extraction, cleaning, and analysis techniques.
- Application of analytical frameworks to explore critical social issues.
- Project management, breaking down abstract research questions into systematic coding and analytical steps.
- Insights into the intersection of technology, workforce composition, and social equity.

1. **Exposure_Score_Code_Output:**
   - Contains the code and output files for AI exposure score analysis.
   - Includes verb-noun pair extraction, matching processes, and risk score calculation scripts.
   - **Note**: Two files in this folder are too large to upload to GitHub (details below).

2. **Gender_Distribution_Analysis:**
   - Includes gender distribution analysis files linked to AI exposure scores.
   - Contains scripts and data visualizations exploring how AI risk disproportionately affects women in the workforce.

## Dataset Information

### Sources:
- **ONET Occupational Data**: Task descriptions and occupational information.
- **Google Patents**: Text descriptions from approximately 15,700 AI patents.
- **Gender Employment Data**: Gender distribution statistics within various occupations.

---

## Key Findings
- Occupations with moderate to high AI exposure risk account for **37.81%** of women in the workforce, placing women in a disadvantaged position as AI technologies become more integrated into decision-making.
- This research highlights that AI models, often trained on biased datasets, can reflect and amplify human prejudices, underscoring the importance of ethical AI development.
